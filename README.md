> A Sufficient Neovim Configuration

This is my Neovim configuration and it suffices for my needs as a researcher, tinkerer, programmer, and writer.
It will always be under construction as I seek to improve it. 

## Technical Details

I tried to configure this configuration mostly in Lua in light of the Vimscript 9 divergence slowly occurring between Vim and Neovim although it does use Vimscript where it makes sense here and there.

- **Package Manager:** Packer
- **Neovim Version Required:** 0.7.0

## Features

> :warning: The feature list here will be a work in progress of what is encompassed by this configuration

- Extensive writing support
