-- A minimal, configurable, neovim style tabline.
-- REMOVAL REASON: Although the tabs looked great and were nice to have, its inability to save names of tab groups across sessions led me to deprecate this plugin in favor of Taboo.vim.
-- use {'nanozuki/tabby.nvim', config = [[require('config.tabby')]]}


-- A theme for vim and neovim [CONFIGURED]
-- REMOVAL REASON: I enjoyed this colorscheme but gruvbox.nvim called me back to its warm embrace
-- use { 'EdenEast/nightfox.nvim', config = [[require('config.nightfox')]] }


-- Clean and elegant distraction-free writing for NeoVim
-- REMOVAL REASON: Although I really liked this, it is just not mature enough and I found it cumbersome to configure when it didn't work just yet out of the box - switching back to Goyo
-- use { 'Pocco81/true-zen.nvim', config = [[require('config.true-zen')]] }
